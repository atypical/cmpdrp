# CMPDRP

## TO DO

Things that could be better or added...

* Show a message if not compatible file format

* Drag a directory of images into window? (not sure if this is possible for JS security reasons)

* Separate key input to navigate index thumbs/list and select (sort of have this...)

* Show read/load progress

* Drag thumbs in index overlay to re-arrange

* Image detail display? (file name, dimensions, file size, etc.)

* Handle duplicate files better (jumpToFile will always go to first match if duplicate file names)

* Scale thumbnails up/down

* Better file name tooltip on thumb
