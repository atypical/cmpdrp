# CMPDRP

CMPDRP is a simple way to view website design comps in a desktop browser. Simply drag and drop your images into the browser window. Images are aligned to the top of the window and horizontally centered (horizontal scrolling is disabled) because that's how I need it right now.

Note: You are viewing files on _your own machine_. Files are _NOT_ uploaded to any server. No one else can see what you are seeing (unless they are standing behind you).

## TO DO

Things that could be better or added...

* Show a message if not compatible file format

* Drag a directory of images into window? (not sure if this is possible for JS security reasons)

* Separate key input to navigate index thumbs/list and select (sort of have this...)

* Show read/load progress

* Drag thumbs in index overlay to re-arrange

* Image detail display? (file name, dimensions, file size, etc.)

* Handle duplicate files better (jumpToFile will always go to first match if duplicate file names)

* Scale thumbnails up/down

* Better file name tooltip on thumb

## ABOUT

This is a simple tool, built quickly to solve a specific use case I encountered. It's not meant to solve all problems for everyone, but I am happy to share it as a reference or starting point for similar applications.
